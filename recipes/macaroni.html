        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This recipe will make a scrumptious, cheesy, and heartwarning vegan mac and cheese!</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups raw cashews</li>
            <li>2 cups water</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
            <li>1/2 cup nutritional yeast</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon turmeric</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
            <li>1 (7-oz) bag shredded vegan cheddar cheese, optional</li>
            <li>12 ounces elbow pasta</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven and prep: If planning on baking it with the breadcrumb topping, preheat the oven to 350 degrees F and lightly grease a casserole dish (I used a 9Ã—13 inch dish). Skip this step for stovetop mac and cheese.</li>
            <li>Soak the cashews: Soften your cashews by covering them in boiling water for 5 minutes. I do this by heating up water in my tea kettle, and then pouring the boiling water over the cashews in a large glass measuring cup. </li>
            <li>Cook pasta: Cook the pasta according to package instructions, but do not overcook. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>Blend cheese sauce: Drain the soaked cashews and discard the soaking water. Add the cashews, 2 cups fresh water, lemon juice, nutritional yeast, turmeric, garlic powder, salt and bag of shredded cheese (if using) to a high powered blender and blend until very smooth.</li>
        </ol>
