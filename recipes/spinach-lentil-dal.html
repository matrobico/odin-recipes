            <li>1 large yellow onion, finely diced</li>
            <li>3 medium carrots, diced (peeled or not)</li>
            <li>6 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>5 cups (1.2 L) low-sodium vegetable broth</li>
            <li>1 pound (450g) baby potatoes, quartered (peel left on)</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups (300g) French green lentils (AKA Puy lentils)</li>
            <li>1 28-ounce (800g) can whole peeled tomatoes</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>Freshly cracked black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons aged balsamic vinegar</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven or soup pot over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the onion, along with a pinch or two of salt. Cook until onion has softened and golden brown, 6 to 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the carrots and garlic and another pinch of salt. Cook until the carrots are just starting to soften, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <l>Pour in a bit of the vegetable broth to deglaze the pot and scrape up any browned bits. Add the remaining broth, lentils, potatoes, bouquet garni, crushed tomatoes (including their juices), 1 ½ teaspoons kosher salt, and pepper to taste. Stir well.</l>
            <li>Bring the soup to a boil. Then reduce heat to low, cover the pot partially, and simmer the soup for 40 to 50 minutes, or until the lentils are tender.</li>
            <li>Remove the bouquet garni. Stir in the dijon mustard and balsamic vinegar and taste. Add more salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        </ol>
